# Carbon Intesity App

A mobile app for iOS and Android that can be used to minimise the users' CO2 emissions at a local level by advising users when to turn on/off energy-intensive applications.\
Users can create reminders for low/ high forecasted carbon intensity periods. Uses the Carbon Intensity API by National Grid ESO.
